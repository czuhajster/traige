# WElCOME TO TRAiGE! ⚕️

## The Future of Automated, Real-Time Triage Systems

We are thrilled to introduce **Traige**, the groundbreaking solution designed to revolutionize the way military personnel and healthcare professionals perform medical triage. With Traige, we are bringing the power of automation and real-time processing to your fingertips, ensuring that you can make faster, more accurate decisions when it matters the most.

### 🚀 Features

- **Automated Triage**: Our machine model algorithm, trained on medical data, performs an automated medical triage of wounded and injured based on the vital signs.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Traige performs real-time data analysis, as data is streamed from the wearable and mediated through Terra API.
- **Alerting**: Whether you're tech-savvy or not, our intuitive interface makes it easy for anyone to jump in and start using Traige.

### 💡 Why Traige?

In high-pressure circumstances, where medical personnel is overloaded, the process of obtaining critical medical data can be ineffective or inaccurate. Triage solves this issue by analysing vital signs of each individual and ranking them by the severity of their injuries.
